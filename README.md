## Introduction
While working through Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), I came across Conway's Game of Life. I thought a web version of the game would be a fun project utilizing my newly acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS & Javascript.
I will also be including an implementation of the game in Python.

## Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a Turing complete game created by mathematician John Conway in 1970.
